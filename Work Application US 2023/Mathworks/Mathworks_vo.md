## 第一個是問說我為何適合EDG
1. I've spent a lot of time thinking about various career possibilities and I think this is the job that suits me best because many of the skills required for this job are what I'm good at.
2. For example, this job requires software development using some knowledge of machine learning and AI. I have taken these courses at both undergraduate and graduate level and have done some projects. Through these projects, I learned a lot of machine learning models, such as SVM, decision tree and random forest.
3. Also, the job is mostly software development, which I've always been interested in.  I learned object-oriented development in the postgraduate period.
4. So I think I'm a good fit for the job and will prove my worth in future works
   
## 第二個是問說我有何實習經驗，這經驗對我有何幫助
1. I have two internships, one during my undergraduate years as a course assistant in operating systems.My main job at that time was to work with professors on teaching plans and answering student questions during the weekly office hours.
2. Through this internship experience, I have learned better communication skills, such as effectively simplifying questions and tell students. And through teaching, I have strengthened my understanding of this course.
3. The second internship was at Inovonics as a software engineer, my main job was software development. Through this experience, I learned the basic process of software development and how to work with others in a team.
4. For example, we have a half-hour group meeting every week. During the group meeting, we will report the progress of the work to the mentor. If the work encounters difficulties, our group will schedule another time to try to solve the problem. 
5. Through these internship experiences, I have the opportunity to apply the knowledge learned in the classroom to practice, and deepen my understanding of these knowledge
