## 第一個是問說我為何適合EDG
1. I've spent a lot of time thinking about various career possibilities and I think this is the job that suits me best because many of the skills required for this job are what I'm good at.
2. For example, this job requires software development using some knowledge of machine learning and AI. I have taken these courses at both undergraduate and graduate level and have done some projects. Through these projects, I learned a lot of machine learning models, such as SVM, decision tree and random forest.
3. Also, the job is mostly software development, which I've always been interested in.  I learned object-oriented development in the postgraduate period.
4. I did an internship as a software development engineer when I was an undergraduate student and learned some basic knowledge about software development like design patterns.
5. So I think I'm a good fit for the job and will prove my worth in future works
   
## 第二個是問說我有何實習經驗，這經驗對我有何幫助
1. I have two internships, one during my undergraduate years as a course assistant in operating systems.My main job at that time was to work with professors on teaching plans and answering student questions during the weekly office hours.
2. Through this internship experience, I have learned better communication skills, such as effectively simplifying questions and tell students. And through teaching, I have strengthened my understanding of this course.
3. The second internship was at Inovonics as a software engineer, my main job was software development. Through this experience, I learned the basic process of software development and how to work with others in a team.
4. For example, we have a half-hour group meeting every week. During the group meeting, we will report the progress of the work to the mentor. If the work encounters difficulties, our group will schedule another time to try to solve the problem. 
5. Through these internship experiences, I have the opportunity to apply the knowledge learned in the classroom to practice, and deepen my understanding of these knowledge

## 告诉我们您在职业生涯中的最佳工作成就是什么。 是什么让这一成就如此重要？
1. My best work achievement was my last job at Inovonics. The main content of this work is to develop a daily-worn sensor for the elderly that reports abnormal data by monitoring daily activities.
2. The reason it is my best work achievementis that when my group and I started this work, we only had a handbook with data requirements and how to monitor abnormal data, without a single line of code. Therefore, we have to start from scratch with data creation, software development, abnormal activity monitoring, testing.
3. Of course, there were many, many problems. For example, in a task plan meeting, I was assigned to work on website development, but I had no experience with website development before. This caused me to miss software development deadlines. However, our team members helped me in time, and with their help, I successfully completed my part of the work.
4. Through this experience, I learned not to try to solve the problem alone when encountering difficulties, but to communicate more with others and try to get a solution to the problem.
5. In the end, our group successfully completed the project half a month before the deadline, and won great feedback from our mentor.
