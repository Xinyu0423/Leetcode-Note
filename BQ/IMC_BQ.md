1. how your friend describe you:
   1. Easy going person
      1. Listener: like to listen to others talking and think in other's perspective
      2. I enjoy hang out with my friends during the weekend
      3. Go hiking or work out together
   2. Hardworking person
      1. Plan things ahead of time: when we have a project/task to do
      2. Fragmented work: like to cut the work in small chuncks
      3. When there is a group project my friend always like me to be in the team, because xxx.
2. Big mistake
   1. S: NLP project compare and contrast two NLP models, never used any NLP model, divide the work to two subgroup each doing one NLP model, ignore the communcation
   2. T: Start to join with their team to work together
   3. A: looking for help from professors, friends, ask them detail about the each pre-trained model. Had meeting with them, ask the shape of their models and fit with my model Change my scripts to fit theirs.
   4. R: successfully finished the project, the word embedding result yields 90% accuracy. Learned importance of communication, need to check the process of other group.
3. Hardest thing. 
   1. S: My hardest thing is my last internship at Inovonics. The reason is that when my group and I started this work, we only had a handbook with all the requirements, without a single line of code. Therefore, we have to start from scratch with data creation, software development, abnormal activity monitoring, testing. There are a lot of content that we never have experiences with
   2. T:  The main content of this work is to develop a daily-worn sensor for the elderly that reports abnormal data by monitoring daily activitie
   3. A: Ask my teammate for help. Also, I checked a lot of youtube video for front-end web design using React, and I have some experience with HTML which helps me understand quicker about React.
   4. R: In the end, our group successfully completed the project half a month before the deadline, and won great feedback from our mentor.

4. unsigned vs signed
   1. Same distinct value, both represent 2^32 number of distinct number. Unsigned represent numeber from 0 to 2^32-1, where signed represent number from -2^31 to 2^31-1
   
5. hash table vs binary search
   1. A hash algorithm can generate a location and jump straight to it in memory or on disk while binary search reads data during each comparison to decide what to read next

6. Describe binary search
   1. The way for binary search work is on a a sorted list. In that case we can have a game that guess number from 1 to 100, the machine tell us if our guess is bigger or smaller to the correct result. Each time we divivde the the solution range to half until we get the correct result. For example

7. Sorting can be done in O(n) time
   1. In certerin sernioal, redix sort can do sorting in O(n) time. The idea of Radix Sort is to do digit by digit sort starting from least significant digit to most significant digit. If the base of the number is equal to n, the time complicity for redix is O(nlogn_n) which is O(n)
