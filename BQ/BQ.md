# Behavior Questions

## tell me an experience when you received negative feedback
   1. S/T:
      1. When I took User center design class last fall semester, the professor give us an assignment to design the user interface of a mobile phone application. (we don't need to implement this user interface, we just need to draw the user interface and use figma after a few milestones Complete simple prototyping)
      2. My idea is to make a daily calorie calculator, the user can calculate the user's calorie intake for the day by entering what he eats each day.
      3. Since I have no previous experience in designing a user interface for mobile software, I misestimated the complexity of this task and did not think about many details of software design. I only drew 4 user interface diagrams and handed in the assignment.
      4. A few days later, I received feedback from the professor that the design I made was too simple, and misses many details, such as the cooking method of the food, were not clearly written.
   2. A
      1. I realized this problem. Then I scheduled 2 individual meetings with the professor to ask the professor about how to improve my design and record the solutions. Also, I started to download and check out some of the calorie-counting apps already available in the Apple Store. I got some inspiration to perfect my prototyping by watching how their mobile apps design the user interface.
      2. ex: For example, to solve the problem of different calorie caused by different ingredients due to different cooking methods, we allow users to add cooking methods of food after the user selects the ingredients or design some popular food cooking methods (for example, the cooking method of potatoes may have fries or mashed potatoes)
   3. R
      1. I learned the importance of project evaluation and timely communication. In the end I got a good grade on this assignment and got an A in the grade for this class

## describe your favorite project and your contribution and why you like this project?
1. My favourate project is my last job at Inovonics. The main content of this work is to develop a daily-worn sensor for the elderly that reports abnormal data by monitoring daily activities.
2. The reason it is my best work achievementis that when my group and I started this work, we only had a handbook with data requirements and how to monitor abnormal data, without a single line of code. Therefore, we have to start from scratch with data creation, software development, abnormal activity monitoring, testing.
3. Of course, there were many, many problems. For example, in a task plan meeting, I was assigned to work on website development, but I had no experience with website development before. This caused me to miss software development deadlines. However, our team members helped me in time, and with their help, I successfully completed my part of the work.
4. Through this experience, I learned not to try to solve the problem alone when encountering difficulties, but to communicate more with others and try to get a solution to the problem.
5. In the end, our group successfully completed the project half a month before the deadline, and won great feedback from our mentor.

## Why XXX Company?
1. I've spent a lot of time thinking about various career possibilities and I think this is the job that suits me best because many of the skills required for this job are what I'm good at.
2. For example, this job requires software development using some knowledge of machine learning and AI. I have taken these courses at both undergraduate and graduate level and have done some projects. Through these projects, I learned a lot of machine learning models, such as SVM, decision tree and random forest.
3. Also, the job is mostly software development, which I've always been interested in.  I learned object-oriented development in the postgraduate period.
4. I did an internship as a software development engineer when I was an undergraduate student and learned some basic knowledge about software development like design patterns.
5. So I think I'm a good fit for the job and will prove my worth in future works

## Tell me about your Internship experience
1. I have two internships, one during my undergraduate years as a course assistant in operating systems.My main job at that time was to work with professors on teaching plans and answering student questions during the weekly office hours.
2. Through this internship experience, I have learned better communication skills, such as effectively simplifying questions and tell students. And through teaching, I have strengthened my understanding of this course.
3. The second internship was at Inovonics as a software engineer, my main job was software development. Through this experience, I learned the basic process of software development and how to work with others in a team.
4. For example, we have a half-hour group meeting every week. During the group meeting, we will report the progress of the work to the mentor. If the work encounters difficulties, our group will schedule another time to try to solve the problem. 
5. Through these internship experiences, I have the opportunity to apply the knowledge learned in the classroom to practice, and deepen my understanding of these knowledge
